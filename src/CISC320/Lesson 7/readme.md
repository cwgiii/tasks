My solution is a hashmap that uses each student id as a key, and associates each id with the the lowest page ID, latest page ID, total points, and number of times scores were entered. The reason that the total point and number of scores are recorded seprately is as more entries are added if you must keep track of how many entries there have been in order to correctly record the average. The way that the lowest page ID and latest page ID are recoreded is with each entry if the letter P is chosen, it will record the time stamp and page ID. Then once all input is recieved it will go through the map and for each value find the latest page ID and lowest along with the average score for each ID in the map.

The expected run time of this algorithm is O(s*log(s) + L). The reason for this is insertion into a hashmap is O(L), and then the process of finding the lowest/latest page id/average score will take s*log.
